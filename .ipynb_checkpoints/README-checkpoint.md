# Alpha Signal Research Platform

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline built in Python to engineer, evaluate, and visualize alpha signals from equity market data. This project focuses on predicting short-term stock return directions based on technical indicators.

---

## Project Goals
- Ingest historical ETF data (SPY, QQQ, IWM)
- Engineer predictive features (SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Train machine learning models to classify next-day returns (up/down)
- Evaluate model confidence and signal effectiveness
- Lay the groundwork for future strategy simulation and deployment

---

## Features Engineered
- Rolling technical indicators:
  - Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Bollinger Band Width (BBW)
- Lagged returns and volatility
- Categorical target: `1` for next-day up, `0` for down

---

## First ML Model
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation:
  - Initial accuracy ~48% (baseline)
  - Confidence filtering improves precision but lowers recall
  - Built-in confidence threshold to filter weaker signals
